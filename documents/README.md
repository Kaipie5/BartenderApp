## Overview
This app uses the Cocktail Db API to request information on various cocktails and recipes, and streamlines the process to allow the user to efficiently search for information they want that is available in the database. The User may search for cocktails via the name of the cocktail or search for various cocktails via their base liquor. The user may also save their favorite recipes in their recipe book, which will be supported via a SQL databse.
