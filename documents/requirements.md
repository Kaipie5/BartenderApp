VISION:
This project is designed to serve as an at home bartender helper.  This project is targeted at people at home who do not have much experience mixing their own drinks, and serves as a place to look up new recipes and save your favorites to make later. People should take note of this product because it will make home-bartending quick and easy without having to spend big money on mixology literature. 

SCOPE:
IN scope:
(features)  * Users will be able to search drink by name
            * Users will be able to search drink by ingredient
            * The web app will provide recipes and descriptions for each search result
            * Users will be able to save search result to databse of recipes called your  Recipe Book
            * Users will be able to delete recipes from your recipe book you ae no longer interested in
OUT of scope:
(features)  * (tentatitve) Users will not be able to view locations               that serve drinks they are interested in

MVP:
Our MVP functionality will consist of a user being able to search for drinks, either by drink name or base type, view the recipe for that drink, and add it to a database that the user can view later.
Stretch Goals:
We would like users to be able to change the recipe of saved drinks based on the user's individual tastes.  We would also like the users to be able to view locations near them that serve the selected drink(yelp api?).

Non-Functional Requirements:
Usability:
Users will have clear visual cues indicating what buttons to click and what their function will be.  Users will have to follow as few steps as possible to search for and add drinks.
Maintainability:
Our web app will require little to no upkeep, assuming the API continues to function the same way it was when the app was designed.  All saved search results and recipes will be coming directly from the API and all database results will be added by the user, based on information provided by the API so there is really very little for the developers to do as far as maintaining the app. Adding additional functionality may change the maintainability a little bit, depending on the feature added.
